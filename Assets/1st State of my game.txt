Finally at the entrance!! Wait...there are 2 entrances!! Maybe there's a hint in my journal? Lets see: "A few ways there is to touch the sky but first you must choose to try. A dangerous wilderness or a dark creepy sounds a waits you, pick a bath or turn back!!" So i can go to the jungle or to the caves? Which one do i prefer to go?

1. Jungles are awesome!
2. Caves are mysterious!
